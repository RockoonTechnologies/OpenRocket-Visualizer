- Position in-flight
- The Setting (being worked on), the time of day, location, etc


## Installation

Get the latest release from the "Releases" Tab.

**Currently only windows is available.**

Unzip the file, and run the .exe

Click on the "Export data" Tab.

This will bring up the window we need. 
First of all, ensure "Field Seperator String", is a ",".

Then, we must select the data to Export, select the following, in order:
1. Time
2. Altitude
3. Position East of Launch
4. Position North of Launch
5. Roll Rate
6. Pitch Rate
7. Yaw Rate

Then click the "Export" button in the lower right corner.

Choose anywhere to place the file, just remember its path.


Now you can open the Visulizer, and you will be presented with the menu.

Here you can choose settings and get a preview of the model you choose.

You can begin by setting the coordinates of your "scene", this is how you set the destination of where-ever you want to simulate your rocket. 
You can also change some other things, changing the time of day, and the model of your rocket.

More importantly though, there is a input field for the path of your simulation. Enter the path of your simulation export.

Now, click "Launch!" and see a visualization of your model.
